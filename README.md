# Synthetic-Data-Generation-with-CTGAN-for-Flood-Forecasting-in-Bangladesh
Trained CTGAN on real weather-related data (continuous and categorical features). Utilized Table Evaluator for thorough quality assessment, comparing synthetic and real data across features. In case of Cumulative Sums per feature, except for Bright_sunshine and Wind_speed, the synthetic data for rest of the features are mostly the same.
