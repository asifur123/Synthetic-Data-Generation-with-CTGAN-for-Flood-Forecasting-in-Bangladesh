# Synthetic-Data-Generation-with-CTGAN-for-Flood-Forecasting-in-Bangladesh
Trained CTGAN on real weather-related data (continuous and categorical features). Utilized Table Evaluator for thorough quality assessment, comparing synthetic and real data across features. In case of Cumulative Sums per feature, except for Bright_sunshine and Wind_speed, the synthetic data for rest of the features are mostly the same.

Synthetic Data Generation with CTGAN: Successfully employed the cutting-edge Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) technique to generate synthetic tabular data for flood forecasting. CTGAN is a deep learning-based method specifically designed for creating synthetic data that closely mimics the statistical properties and distribution of real data.

Methodological Expertise: Demonstrated proficiency in using CTGAN to address the scarcity of labeled flood-related data by creating a larger and more diverse dataset through synthetic data generation. This innovative approach allowed for the augmentation of the available data and enhanced the performance of downstream predictive models.

Quality Assessment and Comparison: Leveraged TableEvaluator to rigorously evaluate and compare the quality of the generated synthetic data with the real data. The evaluation encompassed both continuous and categorical features, providing insights into how closely the synthetic data aligned with the original dataset. This analysis confirmed the synthetic data's effectiveness in replicating the statistical characteristics of real-world weather and flood-related data.

Data Preprocessing and Model Integration: Skillfully executed data preprocessing tasks, including label encoding of categorical features and standardization of numerical features. Integrated the generated synthetic data with the authentic dataset, creating a balanced and comprehensive data repository for the development of robust flood forecasting models.

Innovative Data Augmentation Approach: Demonstrated the ability to think creatively and leverage advanced techniques like CTGAN to address data scarcity issues, thereby showcasing a proactive and innovative approach to solving real-world data challenges.
